#The below L2 firewall controllerinserts flow table entries as soon as a connectionUp event is triggered. v3 tries to make the firewall appication reactive, by inserting the flow mod only during a packetIn event, but since the l2 switching appliation too seems to be processing the packet, an buffer already in use related error is thrown at the user. 
#To circumvent the issue, the below code inserts higher priority flowtable entry as soon as a connection is made, avoiding the contention of buffer in total.

# generic info
# all mentioned events ex:ConnectionUp and PacketIn can be found in pox/openflow/__init__.py
# all events have min of 3 attributes 1. connection 2.ofp (of packet which triggerd the event) 3.dpid
#though there is no req for controller to maintain mac addr table, since the ft on switch expires its always a good idea to have a ref on controller -- macaddrtable{}
#in v5 version, trying to accomodate multiple switches.
